---------------

This project has the WinForms application. It has two forms, one called **DownloadSpeedOldSchool.cs** which showcases the old .Net 1.1 APM style of doing it, and it has a form called **DownloadSpeedAsync.cs** which uses the new async/await keyword. You can change the one you want to test in Program.cs.
